                    • We promote PinkCards.com online with SEO techniques and spending thousands on Ad-words each month, going viral on social media and other platforms using white hat techniques, a TV ad or two as well as some PR events.  As soon as anyone lands on our home page they are asked to enter in their Town City or Postcode.  We than re-direct them to the nearest Pink Partner from that geo location as defined by Google.
                </p>
                <p style="display: none;">
                   • We also bind FREE SEO to your URL from the day you register your store.  This will help drive local traffic to your URL organically and can take up to 6 months to take affect.  You can modify the content and Meta tags yourself and also enhance our efforts with your own efforts.

                <p style="display: none;">
                    • We ask Pink Partners to promote their OWN URL using local marketing and advertising method. We encourage EVERY partner to spread the word quickly by working with local taxi companies or local restaurants. Details of this and other marketing initiatives will be explained in detail at a later stage.
